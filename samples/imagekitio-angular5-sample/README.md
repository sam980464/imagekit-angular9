# Imagekit Angular 5 Sample

This project shows the usage of ImageKit Angular SDK in an Angular 5 app. Please note that you need to have `@angular/cli v1.6.*` installed to run this application. If you are on latest version, you can uninstall current version and install required one like this: 


```sh
> npm remove -g @angular/cli
> npm install -g @angular/cli@1.6.6
> ng --version
  @angular/cli: 1.6.6
```

## Running the application

Before you can use Imagekit SDK, you need to provide config values required in `app.module.ts` and `app.component.ts`. You can either configure your environment and take values from there, or directly provide in respective files.

To start the application, use `npm start` command.
