# Imagekit Angular 6 Sample

This project shows the usage of ImageKit Angular SDK in an Angular 6 app. Please note that you need to have `@angular/cli v6.1.*` installed to run this application. If you are on latest version, you can uninstall current version and install required one like this: 


```sh
> npm remove -g @angular/cli
> npm install -g @angular/cli@6.1.1
> ng --version
  @angular/cli: 6.1.1
```

## Running the application

Before you can use Imagekit SDK, you need to provide config values required in `app.module.ts` and `app.component.ts`. You can either configure your environment and take values from there, or directly provide in respective files.

To start the application, use `npm start` command.
